# Welcome to Graph-ICS Contributing Guide

First of all *thank you* that you made it this far! :)

## Getting started

- To get an overview of the project read the [README](README.md) first.
- Build Graph-ICS from the source code (find instructions in the [README](README.md))
- Before you start to code make sure to create an issue using one of the templates to be safe that your feature or bug has not already been developed but is not released yet.
- Before starting a pull-request format your C++ code using clang-format and the .clang-format config provided in the repository.
- For QML code use the built-in formatter provideded by the QtCreator.

That's it! Happy coding :)
