-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical Note:

The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) was initially developed
under contract to the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes
of Health. ITK is partially derived from VTK and VXL, hence some code is
copyrighted accordingly (see VTKCopyright.txt and VXLCopyright.txt).

The copyright of most of the files in the "Utilities" subdirectory is held by
third parties who allow to distribute this material under a license compatible
with the one used by ITK. Please read the content of the subdirectories for
specific details on those third-party licenses. You will also find details in
the README.txt file under the "Copyright" subdirectory.

Starting with its version ITK 3.6, The Insight Toolkit is distributed under the
new and simplified BSD license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php].

Starting with its version ITK 4, The Insight Toolkit is distributed under the
Apache 2.0 License

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Toolkit contains code from third parties that have different
copyrights.

They are:


 1) DICOMParser:  Copyright by Matt Turek.
                  Distributed under a BSD-Like license.
                  [This work was funded by NLM so its copyright
                   should probably be transfered to the ISC.]

 2) AnalyzeDB.h:  The Mayo Clinic aggreed to distribute this file
                  with ITK. Point of contact: Vincent Magnotta.
                  The file was moved to Utilities/itkExtHdrs

 3) PixelData:    GE Copyrights,
                  Vincent is contacting the providers of this
                  code too.

 6) Netlib:       Netlib is a conglomerate of packages. Each
                  one having different copyrights and licenses.
                  Here is a listing of what is included inside
                  Utilities/vxl/v3p/netlib

    blas:         From www.netlib.org/blas :

    FAQ: The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package.
    It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web.
    Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has been).
    We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.


    datapac:   Written by James Filliben, National Bureau of Standars.

           Our understanding is that the US Government cannot hold
           copyrights, therefore we assume that this code is in the
           public domain.

    eispack:

    lapack:

    laso:

    libf2c:

    linalg:

    linpack:

    mathews:

    minpack:

    napack:

    opt:

    temperton:

    tests:

    toms:



 7) The triangle.c/h and showme.c files have been removed.
                  Their copyright/license was incompatible with
                  ITK and their functionality was not needed.
                  These removed the "itknetlib" library.


 8) itk_hash_map:  It has copyrights by SGI and HP, but the license
                  is consistent with BSD-like. So we simply need
                  to acknowledge those in our general copyright.

 9) itkMersenneTwisterRandomVariateGenerator:
                Copyright: Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura,
                Copyright: Richard J. Wagner
                under a BSD-Like license.

 10) Code/Numerics/FEM/dsrc2c.c :

                Copyright: 1977 IMSL Inc, no license available.
                Stephen Aylward removed the specific functions
                in this file that were copyrighted by IMSL and
                replaced them with other functions available in
                netlib. The file is now cleared from copyright
                concerns.


 11) Code/Numerics/cvsrmvend

                Copyright:  Greg A. Woods
                "Freely distributable"
                I guess that counts as BSD...
                Easy to remove if it becomes a problem,
                This is just a script for making easier
                the CVS syncs of VXL.

  12) Testing/Code/Numerics/NeuralNetworks:

                Copyright: CADDLab at UNC
                Fixed now in CVS --> ISC



Utilities:


  A) JPEG      :  Thomas G Lane ( BSD-Like)
               :  DCMTK : OFFIS... and many others... but BSD-Like


  B) OpenJPEG  :  Universite Catholique de Louvain:  BSD license


  C) NrrdIO      :  Gordon Kindlmann and  University of Utah
                  BSD-Like license. Clarifies that the original
                  package "Teem" (not in ITK) is still under GPL license


  D) NIFTI     :  No copyright ?
                  There is no mention of licensing nor copyright
                  at the NIFTI Web site:

                      http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1

                  However at http://niftilib.sourceforge.net it
                  appears as "public domain" license, but in
                  its subdirectory matlibs it has a GPL license.
                  The matlibs subdirectory is not included in ITK.

                  The subdirectory jlibs is public domain
                  The subdirecotry clibs is public domain


     in ITK it had a subdir:

        fsliolib  :  From the FSL package:
                     University of Oxford:
                     NO FOR COMMERCIAL USE

                     This code has now been removed.


  E) EXPAT     : Thai Open Source Software Center Ltd and Clark Cooper.
                 with BSD-Like license


  F) PNG       : Copyright: Glen Randers-Pehrson
