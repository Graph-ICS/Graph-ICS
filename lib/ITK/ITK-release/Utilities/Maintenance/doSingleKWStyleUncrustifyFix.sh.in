## the intent of this file is to clean the files, make them KWSTYLE compliant,
## and then make sure that subsequent runs of this script do not modify `
## The goal of this script is to develop a consistent system of auto-formating
## and format testing such that if uncrustify is run, then the code will pass
## the KWStyle format checker
