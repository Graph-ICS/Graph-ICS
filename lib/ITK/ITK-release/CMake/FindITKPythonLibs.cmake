# FindITKPythonLibs
# -----------------
#
# FindITKPythonLibs is a work around to avoid a bug in FindPythonLibs.cmake .
# This module should always be used in place of FindPythonLibs. The code
# contained in this file will be directly integrated in FindPythonLibs.cmake in
# CMake (version more recent than 3.7.1).
#
# PYTHON_LIBRARY may contain a list because of SelectLibraryConfigurations.
# If it is the case, the list can be:
#
# ::
#
#   optimized;<FILEPATH_TO_RELEASE_LIBRARY>;debug;<FILEPATH_TO_DEBUG_LIBRARY>
#
# In this case, we need to set PYTHON_LIBRARY to one value, otherwise
# get_filename_component will crash (too many arguments).
# If SelectLibraryConfigurations was run, then the individual
# PYTHON_LIBRARY_<CONFIG> values have been populated.
